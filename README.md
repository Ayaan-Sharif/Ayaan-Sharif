### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ayaan Sharif** 

pursuing **AI and Data Science(B-TECH)** from Mumbai University! 


Welcome to my GitHub profile, where bits and bytes come out to play and Python reigns supreme each day. I'm a lover of all things tech, and my GitHub is my open spec.

ðŸ“‚ **My Repositories** ðŸ“‚

My repositories are like my children, my pride. Each one unique, with code inside. From web apps to data analysis tools, I've got it all, no need for schools.

ðŸ”¥ **My Commits** ðŸ”¥

My commits are like sparks of fire, each one igniting my coding desire. With each push, my skills are honed, and my coding prowess, fully blown.

ðŸŒŽ **Let's Make a Difference** ðŸŒŽ

So come and join me on this coding spree. Together, we'll conquer the world, you'll see. Fork a repo, contribute with glee, and let's make this world a better place to be.

So if you want to join in on the fun,
And be enlightened by what I've done,
Come and checkout my repos with ease,
And together, let's code with a breeze!
